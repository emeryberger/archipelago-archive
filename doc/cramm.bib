  paper assumes a transaction oriented collection scheme, as proposed by
  Deutsch and Bobrow, the necessary features of which are summarised.
  Implementing the described optimisations requires global flow analysis to be
  performed on the source program. It is shown that at compile time certain
  program actions that affect the reference counts of cells can be deduced.
  This information is then used to find actions that cancel when the code is
  executed and those that can be grouped to achieve improved efficiency."

This paper explains a technique that allows the use of conservative garbage
collection on general memory allocators. This is possible by using two data
structures named malloc-tables and jump-tables that are computed at
garbage collection time to map pointers to beginning of objects and their
sizes. This paper describes malloc-tables and jump-tables, an
implementation of a malloc/jump-table based conservative garbage
collector for Doug Lea's memory allocator, and experimental results that
compare this implementation with Boehm-Demers-Weiser's GC, a
state-of-the-art conservative garbage collector.

  abstract = {In this paper, we present a flexible and efficient infrastructure for building memory allocators that is based on C++ templates and inheritance. This novel approach allows programmers to build custom and general-purpose allocators as "heap layers" that can be composed without incurring any runtime overhead or additional programming cost. We show that this infrastructure simplifies allocator construction and results in allocators that either match or improve the performance of heavily-tuned allocators written in C, including the Kingsley allocator and the GNU obstack library. We further show this infrastructure can be used to rapidly build a general-purpose allocator that has performance comparable to Lea's allocator, the best uniprocesor allocator of which we are aware. We thus demonstrate a clean, easy-to-use allocator interface that seamlessly combines the power and efficiency of any number of general and custom allocators within a single application.},
