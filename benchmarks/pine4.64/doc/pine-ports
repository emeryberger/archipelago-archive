    Linux
	(On some platforms the vsnprintf implementation is apparently not
	 correct, and pine will crash early on with a SegFault. The only
	 place where pine uses vsnprintf is in the debugjournal() routine
	 in .../pine/osdep/debuging.tim. You can exclude this by compiling
	 without DEBUGJOURNAL defined. Try a build command like
	   ./build DEBUG="-g -DDEBUG" lnp
	 to work around this problem. August, 2003)
