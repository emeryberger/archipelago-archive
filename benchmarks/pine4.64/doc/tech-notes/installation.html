<H1>Building and Installation</H1>

<H2><A NAME="compile">Compile-time Options</A></H2>

The files you may need to modify are <CODE>./{pico,pine}/makefile.xxx</CODE>,
<CODE>./{pico,pine}/osdep/os-xxx.h</CODE>, and possibly
<CODE>./{pico,pine}/osdep/os-xxx.ic</CODE>,
where <EM>xxx</EM> is the 3-letter code for your platform.
You can give the command <CODE>build help</CODE> to see
the list of ports incorporated into <EM>Pine</EM> and their
associated 3-letter codes.
The files <CODE>./{pico,pine}/makefile.xxx</CODE> are where you would
set compiler options.
By default, <EM>Pine</EM> will be compiled with debugging
on, optimization and profiling off.
Note that if you compile with DEBUG off,
then <EM>Pine</EM> will not create its normal debug files, no matter how the
debug-level and debug command line flag are set.  <P>

Some of these can only be set when you compile.  Others,
however, can be overridden by command-line flags to <EM>Pine</EM> or settings in
<EM>Pine</EM>'s user or system configuration files.
Some of the options which can be set when compiling: 

<H3><A NAME="ldap-compile">Including LDAP Functionality</A></H3>

In order to build <EM>Pine</EM> with LDAP functionality included you
need to supply the LDAP library and include files.
<EM>Pine</EM> has been successfully built with OpenLDAP 2.0.x, OpenLDAP 1.x,
the University of Michigan LDAP library (ldap-3.3),
and with the Netscape Directory SDK 1.0 LDAP library.
<P>

Set up a symlink called <CODE>ldap</CODE> in the top-level
<CODE>pine</CODE> directory (the directory where the <EM>Pine</EM>
<CODE>build</CODE> script is located).
The <CODE>build</CODE> script will call <CODE>contrib/ldap-setup</CODE> to
help figure out how to use the LDAP libraries.
It expects to find directories
<CODE>ldap</CODE>, <CODE>ldap/include</CODE>, <CODE>ldap/libraries</CODE>,
and file <CODE>ldap/include/ldap.h</CODE>.
<P>

There are at least two slightly different styles of LDAP libraries.
One style uses two libraries, libldap and liblber, the other uses just
libldap.
The script is not very smart, but it attempts to figure out which of
these two cases is being used.
Modify the script to fit your situation if you need to.
<P>

When using OpenLDAP as the library (or the older University of
Michigan libary), set up the symlink so that it points to the base of
the ldap source tree.
The ldap-setup script looks for the directory
<CODE>ldap/libraries/liblber</CODE> and the libraries
<CODE>ldap/libraries/libldap.a</CODE> and <CODE>ldap/libraries/liblber.a</CODE>.
<P>

To use the Netscape Directory SDK library, make a directory called
<CODE>ldap</CODE> in the top-level <CODE>pine</CODE> directory (where the
<EM>Pine</EM> <CODE>build</CODE> script is located). That directory should
contain two subdirectories, <CODE>include</CODE> and <CODE>libraries</CODE>.
The <CODE>include</CODE> directory is where you should put the include
files from the Netscape SDK. The <CODE>libraries</CODE> directory is
where you should put the library, <CODE>libldap.a</CODE>.
<P>

The <CODE>build</CODE> script will run the script
<CODE>contrib/ldap-setup</CODE> if you have created an <CODE>ldap</CODE>
symlink or directory. It tries to figure out if the setup is the Univ. of
Michigan code or not. If it is Univ. of Michigan ldap-3.3 or the library
from <CODE>mozilla.org</CODE>, then it
will link against both <CODE>libldap.a</CODE>
and <CODE>liblber.a</CODE>. If it isn't, it will link
against only <CODE>libldap.a</CODE>.
You may find you have to do some tweaking to get this to work with the
libraries you are using.
If you find that a change to <CODE>contrib/ldap-setup</CODE> works for you,
you might think about sending that to us for inclusion in the next
<EM>Pine</EM> release.
<P>

If there is no <CODE>ldap</CODE> symlink, there is still an attempt to
automatically include LDAP support if certain conditions exist.
At this point, the check includes a check for Solaris 8, otherwise the
automatic inclusion is not done.
You may override the automatic inclusion of LDAP with the <CODE>build</CODE>
argument <CODE>NOLDAP</CODE>.
<P>

<EM>Pine</EM> uses LDAPv2 protocol.
When using LDAPv3 protocol, the results are returned in the utf8 character
set.
<EM>Pine</EM> is not yet ready to deal with that, so it tells the server to
use the LDAPv2 protocol.
<P>

<H3><A NAME="krb5-compile">Including Kerberos 5 Functionality</A></H3>

In order to build <EM>Pine</EM> with Kerberos functionality included
you should place
a symlink called <CODE>krb5</CODE> to the directory where your Kerberos5
include files and libraries are located. That is, <CODE>krb5/include</CODE> and
<CODE>krb5/lib</CODE> should exist. Place the symlink 
in the top-level <CODE>pine</CODE> directory (where the
<EM>Pine</EM> <CODE>build</CODE> script is located). See the comments in the
script <CODE>contrib/krb5-setup</CODE> if you have trouble.
<P>

<H3><A NAME="pine-compile">Pine Compile-time Options</A></H3>

<DL COMPACT>

<DT> USE_QUOTAS

<DD> Determines whether quotas are checked on startup.  Default is to not
check the quota. 

<DT> ALLOW_CHANGING_FROM

<DD> This is now a hidden runtime feature called
<A HREF="config.html#allow-from"<EM>allow-changing-from</EM></A>.
Even with this feature turned on, users still have to include <EM>From</EM>
in their <A HREF="config.html#def-comp"><EM>default-composer-hdrs</EM></A>
or <A HREF="config.html#cust-hdr"><EM>customized-hdrs</EM></A>
in order to be able to edit the From line.
<P>

Beginning with version 4.10, a user may also change their From address
by using Roles.
<P>

A system administrator may disallow editing of the From line by putting
the feature <EM>no-allow-changing-from</EM> in the system-wide <EM>fixed</EM>
configuration file. The paranoid system administrator can compile in this
behavior by defining <EM>NEVER_ALLOW_CHANGING_FROM</EM> in
<CODE>./pine/osdep/os-xxx.h</CODE>.

<DT> DEFAULT_DEBUG

<DD> Sets the level of debugging output created in <EM>Pine</EM>'s debug files. 
Default is level 2. The command-line flag -d may also be used to change the
debug level. For example, <CODE>-dverbose=7</CODE>.

<DT> NUMDEBUGFILES

<DD> Sets the number of debug files kept per user.
Default is 4. The command-line flag -d may also be used to change
this. For example, <CODE>-dverbose=3,numfiles=2</CODE>.

<DT> BACKGROUND_POST

<DD> Define this if you want to allow users to turn on the feature that
enables sending to take place in a fork()'d child. This may reduce
the time on the user's wall clock it takes to post mail.
NOTE: You'll also have to make sure the
appropriate <CODE>./pine/osdep/postreap.*</CODE>
file is included in the <CODE>./pine/osdep/os-xxx.ic</CODE> file for
your system.

<DT> NEW_MAIL_TIME

<DD> Interval between new-mail checks.  Default is 150 seconds. 
This is obsolete. This should be set in a
configuration file by setting the variable
<A HREF="config.html#mail-check"><EM>mail-check-interval</EM></A>.

<DT> OVERLAP

<DD> Number of lines overlap when user views the next page of a message. 
Default is 2 lines. 
This is obsolete. This should be set in a
configuration file by setting the variable
<A HREF="config.html#overlap"><EM>viewer-overlap</EM></A>.

<DT> PASSFILE

<DD> <EM>WARNING!</EM> Turning this on is very dangerous and should probably not
be done, except on single user systems!
For <EM>PC-Pine</EM>, this is turned on by default and set to the
filename <CODE>PINE.PWD</CODE>.  It may be overridden by the
-passfile command-line argument.
You may enable it for Unix systems by defining PASSFILE to be a filename
which will be located in the same directory as the pinerc file, usually the
home directory.
<P>
The file is used to save passwords from one session to the next.
Even if you define PASSFILE when you compile <EM>Pine</EM>, 
password saving will not be enabled by default, but requires the
existence of the file (the name of which is the value of PASSFILE).
Even with the existence of this file, the user must still acknowledge a
prompt before the password is saved to the file.
If <EM>Pine</EM> is configured
to access several different IMAP servers, each password entered will be
kept (associated with the corresponding host name) in memory during the
current session, and optionally, in the PASSFILE file for use in
subsequent sessions.  <P>

<EM>WARNING</EM>!  Use this feature with caution!  It effectively makes
the user's mail no more secure than the physical security of the machine
running <EM>Pine</EM>.  What's more, while the password is cloaked by a mild
(some might say, feeble) encryption scheme, it is nonetheless sitting in a
file on the disk and subject to cracking by anyone with access to it. 
<EM>BEWARE</EM>!  <P>

<DT> SENDMAIL
<DT> SENDMAILFLAGS

<DD> Sets the name and flags for the local program that will be called to
handle outgoing email.  Default is <CODE>/usr/lib/sendmail -oi -oem -t</CODE>.
See the <A HREF="background.html#SMTP"><EM>SMTP and Sendmail</EM></A>
section for more details.

<DT> SYSTEM_PINERC

<DD> The name of the file which holds <EM>Pine</EM>
configuration information for
all users on the system.  Default on UNIX systems is
<CODE>/usr/local/lib/pine.conf</CODE>.

<DT> SYSTEM_PINERC_FIXED

<DD> The name of the file which holds the same type of information as for
SYSTEM_PINERC, but only for variables that the administrator wants to keep
fixed.  That is, users are not allowed to change variables that are
specified in the FIXED file.  Default on UNIX systems is
<CODE>/usr/local/lib/pine.conf.fixed</CODE>.

</DL> <P>

There are a couple of more obscure options which are in the source code 
because a few people have asked for them or because we changed our 
minds about them being a good idea in general. 

<DL COMPACT>

<DT> ENCODE_FROMS

<DD> Use Quoted-printable encoding so that <CODE>From</CODE>'s at the
beginning of lines don't end up being escaped by &gt;'s.  Most people seem
to dislike the Q-P encoding more than the &gt; escapes so this is off by
default.  Once everyone has MIME mail readers, we'll turn this on by
default. 

<DT> NO_KEYBOARD_LOCK

<DD> Disable the keyboard locking function in the main menu.  Keyboard
locking is enabled by default.  An easier way to turn off Keyboard locking
is to add the feature
<A HREF="config.html#disable-kblock"><EM>disable-keyboard-lock-cmd</EM></A> to
the feature list variable in the global <CODE>pine.conf</CODE> or
<CODE>pine.conf.fixed</CODE> file. <P>

</DL>

<H3><A NAME="pico-compile">Pico Compile-time Options</A></H3>

There is really only one option settable specifically for <EM>Pico</EM>.
It is for the UNIX <EM>Pico</EM> versions only.
The file that may need some changing is <CODE>./pico/osdep/os_xxx.h.</CODE>.
Whatever is set will
effect the behavior of the <EM>Pico</EM> stand-alone program as well as the
composer within <EM>Pine</EM>. 

<DL COMPACT>

<DT> SPELLER

<DD> Names the program called to do "normal" spell-checking. This can be set
in a configuration file instead by setting the
<A HREF="config.html#speller"><EM>speller</EM></A>
configuration variable.

</DL>

<H3><A NAME="osdep-compile">OS Dependent Compile-time Settings</A></H3>

Most of <EM>Pine</EM>'s (and <EM>Pico</EM>'s) operating system dependent
behaviors are set in the files
<CODE>./pico/osdep/os-xxx.h</CODE> and <CODE>./pico/osdep/os-xxx.ic</CODE>.
The flags in the makefiles are also system dependent. See the comments in
<CODE>./pico/osdep/os-xxx.h</CODE> for more details. One that may come up is:

<DL COMPACT>
<DT> USE_TERMINFO
<DT> USE_TERMCAP

<DD> Instructs <EM>Pine</EM> to use the terminfo (or termcap) database. 
Default varies by system. This has been moved from
<CODE>./pine/osdep/os-xxx.h</CODE> to <CODE>./pico/osdep/os-xxx.h</CODE>.
If you change this you will also have to change the file
<CODE>./pico/osdep/os-xxx.ic</CODE> so that it includes the file
<CODE>term.inf</CODE> instead of <CODE>term.cap</CODE> (or vice versa) and
you will probably have to change the libraries included by the makefiles
<CODE>./{pico,pine}/makefile-xxx</CODE>. Hopefully, it is already set
correctly for each system.

</DL>

<H3><A NAME="imapd-compile">IMAPd Compile-time Options</A></H3>

There are no options or settings required for the version of IMAPd
distributed with <EM>Pine</EM>.  If you need to be doing more complex modifications
to IMAP, then you should pick up the IMAP development package and work
with that code.  The developer's version of IMAP is available for
anonymous ftp from <A
HREF="ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu"><CODE>ftp.cac.washington.edu</CODE></A>
in the directory <CODE>mail</CODE>.  The file is called <A
HREF="ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/mail/imap.tar.Z"><CODE>imap.tar.Z</CODE></A>. 
<P>

<HR>

<H2><A NAME="build">Building the Pine Programs</A></H2>

You may have already compiled <EM>Pine</EM> and tried it out.  If so, great!  If
not, you should be able to do it without too much trouble by following
these step-by-step instructions: <P>

<OL>

<LI> Figure out what platform you're building for.  You can give the
command <CODE>build help</CODE> or look at the list
in <CODE>./doc/pine-ports</CODE> to see the list of ports incorporated into
<EM>Pine</EM>.  What you need is the three letter code for the platform.  Some
examples are <CODE>a41</CODE> for the AIX 4.1 operating system,
<CODE>os4</CODE> for Digital Unix 4.0, and <CODE>lnx</CODE> for Linux.
There are sometimes several variants for a single operating system
(different compilers, shadow passwords or not, etc.) so look through the
whole list in <CODE>./doc/pine-ports</CODE> for the one you want.
If your platform is not in the list of ports, then you might
have some work ahead of you.  First, check the file
<CODE>doc/pine-ports</CODE> to see if there are others working on a port for
your platform or to see if the port is included in the <CODE>contrib</CODE> section
of the source code.  Ports in the <CODE>contrib</CODE> directory were
contributed by <EM>Pine</EM> administrators from around the world, but the <EM>Pine</EM>
development team has not been able to test the code. Some of these ports are
very old and are based on old versions of <EM>Pine</EM>.
If <EM>Pine</EM> has not yet
been ported to your platform at all, read the section on
<A HREF="porting.html">Porting <EM>Pine</EM></A> in this document.  <P>

<LI> Make sure you're in the root of the <EM>Pine</EM> source.  When you type
<CODE>ls</CODE> you should see the following files and directories (or
something close to it): 

<PRE>
	README	build	doc 	makefile	pine
	bin	contrib	imap	pico
</PRE>
<P>

<LI> Make sure you're getting a clean start by giving the command
<CODE>./build clean</CODE>. This should take only a few seconds to run.  <P>

<LI> Give the command <CODE>./build </CODE><EM>xxx</EM> where <EM>xxx</EM>
is the three letter code you picked in step 1.  The compiler should grind
away for a few minutes.  <P>

<LI> When the compilation is complete the sizes of the binaries built
will be displayed.  The actual binaries are in
the various source directories.  In addition, the <CODE>bin</CODE>
directory contains a link to each program compiled.  You can just copy
them out of <CODE>bin</CODE> or try them from there.  <P>

</OL>

<P>
The <CODE>build</CODE> command can be given some options which it passes
on to the subordinate makes.
Some that may be useful are <CODE>EXTRACFLAGS</CODE>,
<CODE>DEBUG</CODE>, and
<CODE>EXTRALDFLAGS</CODE>.
There are also some SSL-related arguments: <CODE>SSLDIR</CODE>,
<CODE>SSLCERTS</CODE>, <CODE>SSLINCLUDE</CODE>, and <CODE>SSLLIB</CODE>.
You should also read the comments in the <CODE>build</CODE> script itself,
which are possibly more up-to-date than this text.

<P>
Here are some examples of options you may want to pass to <CODE>build</CODE>.
This will turn off the debugging files that <EM>Pine</EM> produces,
while leaving
the symbol table information. We believe a better way to do this is to
have an alias for <CODE>pine</CODE> which
executes <CODE>pine -d0</CODE> instead.
This turns off debugging at runtime while preserving the possibility of using
the debugging if a problem turns up.
But if you wanted to turn it off unconditionally you could use the
build argument

<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>
                 DEBUG=-g
</SAMP></CENTER>

<P>
In other words, the command to build a <EM>Pine</EM> with no debugging
would be

<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>
                ./build DEBUG=-g target
</SAMP></CENTER>

<P>
where target is one of the 3-letter port names found in doc/pine-ports.
To also leave out the symbol table information you could pass:

<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>
                DEBUG=
</SAMP></CENTER>

<P>
To turn on the optimizer

<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>
                DEBUG=-O
</SAMP></CENTER>

<P>
It should be ok to move string constants into a read-only area.
We don't think there are any instances where <EM>Pine</EM> modifies a string
constant. So you could pass a flag to your compiler that tells it to do
this. This could cause several hundred K of strings to be moved from
the data area of the program into the text area of the program, and that
should allow that text to be shared among all instances of <EM>Pine</EM>.
To do this, for example, with the AIX <EM>a41</EM> port, you could
pass this to <CODE>build</CODE>:

<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>
                EXTRACFLAGS=-qro
</SAMP></CENTER>

<P>
If you are using OpenSSL but have decided to use a non-standard directory
(standard one is <CODE>/usr/local/ssl</CODE>) for the location
then you can cause <EM>Pine</EM>
to use that directory with

<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>
                SSLDIR=/some/other/dir
</SAMP></CENTER>

<P>
The assumption is that the certs directory is in SSLDIR/certs, the include
directory is SSLDIR/include, and the library directory is SSLDIR/lib.
You can change those assumptions with

<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>
                SSLCERTS=certs_directory
</SAMP></CENTER>
<CENTER><SAMP>
                SSLINCLUDE=include_directory and
</SAMP></CENTER>
<CENTER><SAMP>
                SSLLIB=ssl_library_directory
</SAMP></CENTER>

<P>
If you are having trouble with the SSL compilation you may explicitly exclude
SSL code with <CODE>NOSSL</CODE>.

<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>
                NOSSL
</SAMP></CENTER>

<P>
Similarly,

<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>
                NOLDAP
</SAMP></CENTER>

<P>
The argument

<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>
                EXTRASPECIALS
</SAMP></CENTER>

<P>
can be used to pass arguments to the c-client make which aren't provided
for in the <EM>Pine</EM> build script.
For example, if you want to change the <CODE>FRIZZLE</CODE>
parameter (a made up argument which the c-client make uses) you might be
tempted to type something like

<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>
                ./build FRIZZLE=cruft target
</SAMP></CENTER>

<P>
This does work with make on some platforms, but not on others.
Some makes seem to pass the arguments on to sub-makes, others don't.
If that doesn't work, then EXTRASPECIALS is for you.

<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>
                ./build EXTRASPECIALS="FRIZZLE=cruft" target
</SAMP></CENTER>

<P>
An additional warning. There are some arguments which are overridden
unconditionally in the sub-makes. Hopefully none of the arguments mentioned
above falls in this category, but it is something to look out for if you
are having trouble.
<P>

<HR>

<H2><A NAME="install-unix">Installing Pine and Pico on UNIX Platforms</A></H2>

Installing <EM>Pine</EM> and <EM>Pico</EM> is remarkably simple.  You take the program files
which you have just transferred or built and you move them to the correct
directory on your system.  Most often the binaries go in
<CODE>/usr/local/bin</CODE> though sometimes they are placed in
<CODE>/usr/bin</CODE>.  All the help text is compiled into <EM>Pine</EM> so there
are no <STRONG>required</STRONG> auxiliary files.  <P>

There are, however, three optional auxiliary files: 
<CODE>/usr/local/lib/pine.info</CODE>,
<CODE>/usr/local/lib/pine.conf</CODE>, and
<CODE>/usr/local/lib/pine.conf.fixed</CODE>.  The file
<CODE>pine.info</CODE> contains text on how to get further help on the
local system.  It is part of the help text for the
main menu and should probably refer to the local help desk or the system
administrator.  If this file doesn't exist a generic version which
suggests ``talking to the computer support staff at your site'' is shown. 
The file <CODE>pine.conf</CODE> is used to set system-wide default
configurations for <EM>Pine</EM>.  The file <CODE>pine.conf.fixed</CODE> is also
used to set system-wide default configurations for <EM>Pine</EM>.
The difference
between these two files is that configuration variables set in the
<CODE>pine.conf.fixed</CODE> file may not normally be over-ridden by a
user.  See the section on <A HREF="config.html"><EM>Pine</EM> Configuration</A>
later in this document for details about
the <CODE>pine.conf</CODE> and <CODE>pine.conf.fixed</CODE> files.  <P>

<HR>

<H2><A NAME="install-pc">Installing PC-Pine</A></H2>

<P>
The PC-Pine distribution comes as a .zip file.  To install, unzip the
files to a directory where you would like the program to reside.  Modern
Windows versions come with the capability of unzipping .zip files.  Failing
that, you can use one of the many .zip file extractors out there, or the
pkunzip.exe program that resides on our FTP server.
Following current Windows conventions, a common directory into which the files
could be extracted would be <CODE>C:\Program Files\PC-Pine\</CODE>.

<P>
Having extracted PC-Pine's .zip file to the directory of choice, you can
now run that directory's pine.exe, which is the actual PC-Pine program.
For convenience, you could place shortcuts to it on the task bar, start
menu, etc.

<P>
Upon first running PC-Pine, you may be asked where you would like to
access your Configuration file (called the <I>pinerc</I>).  This
is useful in accessing already existing configuration files, and it
does not matter where this file gets created.  If you are connecting 
to an IMAP server to access your email, it is also possible to store
this Configuration data on that server, which facilitates accessing
the same configuration from multiple machines (in fact, your configuration
may have already been set up this way for use with other pine programs).

<P>
After having established the location of the configuration file, it may be
necessary to specify a few configuration settings before reading or sending
mail.  You may be prompted for the following (which may also be edited from
the (S)etup (C)onfig screen from the Main Menu):

<LI><CODE>Folder to open as inbox</CODE> (or <I>inbox-path</I>) - This can 
be an inbox residing on an IMAP or POP3 server, or one residing locally. 
An example of an INBOX for an IMAP server is: 
<CODE>{server.example.com}INBOX</CODE>.

<LI><CODE>User-id</CODE>, <CODE>Personal name</CODE>, and 
<CODE>host/domain</CODE>, which are to be used as your email address.

<LI><CODE>SMTP server to forward message</CODE> - You must enter your SMTP
server before you can send any messages.

<P>
At this point, you will be able to read and send email messages.  There are,
however, many more preferences that you can set in the Configuration
screen.
<HR>

<H2><A NAME="install-imapd">Installing IMAPd</A></H2>

When the <EM>Pine</EM> distribution is built on a UNIX system, the IMAP server
binary, <CODE>imapd</CODE>, is compiled.  Installing <CODE>imapd</CODE>
requires placing the binary in the appropriate directory, usually
<CODE>/usr/etc</CODE>, and adding entries to <CODE>/etc/services</CODE>
and <CODE>/etc/inetd.conf</CODE> or their counterparts.  The following
line is appropriate for <CODE>/etc/services</CODE>: 

<PRE>
  imap         143/tcp         # Mail transfer 
</PRE>

and the next line is appropriate for <CODE>/etc/inetd.conf</CODE>: 

<PRE>
  imap  stream  tcp     nowait  root    /usr/etc/imapd imapd 
</PRE>

The <CODE>/etc/inetd.conf</CODE> file entry may vary on different versions
of UNIX.  Some have a slightly different set of fields.  Also the pathname
in <CODE>/etc/inetd.conf</CODE> must match the path where
<CODE>imapd</CODE> is installed.  <P>

With this configuration, the IMAP server runs without pre-authentication. 
Each new IMAP connection requires a correct username and password.  IMAP
can also be run with pre-authentication based on the standard <EM>rsh</EM>
mechanism.  To enable this, the user account on the IMAP server must
contain a valid file which grants access to the client machine.  Enabling
<EM>rimap</EM> authentication is done by creating a link called
<CODE>/etc/rimapd</CODE> to <CODE>imapd</CODE>.  Basically, what is
happening is that <EM>Pine</EM> is taking advantage of the ability that
<CODE>rsh</CODE> has to use privileged TCP ports so it doesn't have to run
in privileged mode.  If the <CODE>rimap</CODE> authentication fails it
will drop back to plain password authentication.  <P>

<EM>PC-Pine</EM> cannot take advantage of <EM>rimap</EM> authentication.  Also, if
your system uses a distributed configuration database, like NIS, Yellow
Pages or Netinfo, be sure that appropriate steps are taken to ensure the
above mentioned information is updated.  <P>

<HR>

<H2><A NAME="files-unix">Support Files and Environment Variables:  UNIX Pine</A></H2>

This section lists the various files which <EM>Pine</EM> uses which are not email
folders.  All of these are the default names of files, they may vary based
on <EM>Pine</EM>'s configuration. 

<DL COMPACT>

<DT> /usr/local/lib/pine.conf

</DL> <P>
<EM>PC-Pine</EM>'s help text and help text index file are expected to reside in the
same directory as the <CODE>PINE.EXE</CODE> executable, as they are
essentially extensions of the executable.  The personal configuration file
may be in the same directory as the executable, or if that is inconvenient
because the executable is on a shared or read-only drive, then it can be
in a file named by the <CODE>$PINERC</CODE> environment variable, or in
<CODE>$HOME\PINE\PINERC</CODE>, where if not set, <CODE>$HOME</CODE>
defaults to the root of the current working drive.  <P>

Most of the other support files key off of the location of the
<CODE>PINERC</CODE> file.  However, in the case of the NEWSRC file, the
path <CODE>$HOME\NEWSRC</CODE> is checked first.  Also, the postponed
messages and interrupted message folders are placed in the default folder
collection, normally in the directory <CODE>$HOME\MAIL</CODE>.  <P>

The location of the following support files may be controlled by variables
in the personal or global <EM>Pine</EM> configuration file: signature, addressbook
(and its index file), postponed messages, and newsrc.  <P>

<EM>PC-Pine</EM> uses the following environment variables: 

<DL COMPACT>

<DT> PINERC

<DD> Overrides default path to pinerc file. 

<DT> PINERCEX

<DD> Overrides default path to personal exceptions configuration file. 

<DT> PINECONF

<DD> Optional path to global <EM>Pine</EM> config file. 

<DT> HOME

<DD> If not set, <EM>Pine</EM> uses the root of the current drive, e.g. C: 

<DT> TMPDIR, TMP, or TEMP

<DD> Specifies location of temporary storage area, first one set wins

<DT> COMSPEC

<DD> Specifies shell for external commands. 

<DT> MAILCAPS

<DD> A semicolon delimited list of path names to mailcap files.
